 Understanding Kubernetes Clusters

At a high level, a Kubernetes cluster is composed of two main types of nodes:

 1. Control Plane Node(s)
These nodes are the brains of the cluster. They host the components responsible for managing the overall state and behavior of the cluster. The control plane handles tasks such as:

- Scheduling applications
- Managing workloads
- Monitoring and self-healing
- Rolling out updates

The control plane ensures the desired state of the cluster is maintained.

 2. Worker Nodes
Worker nodes are responsible for running the actual applications. They host the containers scheduled by the control plane. These nodes don’t make decisions on their own; instead, they follow instructions from the control plane. Each worker node includes:

- Kubelet – the agent that communicates with the control plane
- Container runtime – such as containerd or CRI-O to manage containers

 How Kubernetes Works

Kubernetes enables a group of machines—physical or virtual—to work together as a unified cluster. It abstracts the infrastructure so you can deploy containerized applications without being tied to specific machines. Containers allow applications to be packaged in a portable, host-independent format.

Traditional deployment models installed applications directly on specific machines. In contrast, Kubernetes manages the distribution, scaling, and lifecycle of containerized apps automatically.

Kubernetes is open source and production-ready. It offers high availability and resiliency through intelligent scheduling and self-healing mechanisms.

 Kubernetes Cluster Components

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two core resources:

- The Control Plane: Orchestrates and manages the entire cluster.
- Nodes: Serve as the compute machines where applications actually run.

The control plane exposes the Kubernetes API, which both users and internal components (like the Kubelet) use to communicate.

To maintain reliability in a production environment, it’s recommended to run at least three nodes. This helps avoid a single point of failure, especially when running etcd (the cluster’s configuration store) and the control plane on the same node.

 Getting Started with Kubernetes

Kubernetes can be deployed on both virtual and physical infrastructure. To begin local development, you can use tools like:

- Minikube – A lightweight Kubernetes implementation that runs on a single VM
- kind (Kubernetes IN Docker) – For running clusters using Docker containers
- MicroK8s – A low-ops, minimal Kubernetes distribution

These tools are ideal for development and testing environments.

 Setting Up Kubernetes in Production

For setting up production-grade Kubernetes clusters, you have several options:

 Installer Tools
- kubeadm
- kops
- kubespray

 Kubernetes Distributions
These come with bundled tools and sometimes commercial support:
- Rancher
- k3s (lightweight version by Rancher)
- OpenShift (Red Hat)
- VMware Tanzu

Distributions often provide opinionated setups and integrations to simplify operations.

 Managed Kubernetes Services
If you prefer not to manage your own cluster, many cloud providers offer fully managed Kubernetes platforms:
- Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- Google GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
- Microsoft AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
- DigitalOcean DOKS

These services handle upgrades, scaling, and infrastructure maintenance for you.

In its most basic form, scheduling is a sub-category of container orchestration and describes the process of automatically choosing the right (worker) node to run a containerized workload on. In the past, scheduling was more of a manual task where a system administrator would choose the right server for an application by keeping track of the available servers, their capacity and other properties like where they are located.

In a Kubernetes cluster, the kube-scheduler is the component that makes the scheduling decision, but is not responsible for actually starting the workload. The scheduling process in Kubernetes always starts when a new Pod object is created. Remember that Kubernetes is using a declarative approach, where the Pod is only described first, then the scheduler selects a node where the Pod actually will get started by the kubelet and the container runtime.
