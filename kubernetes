 Understanding Kubernetes Clusters

At a high level, a Kubernetes cluster is composed of two main types of nodes:

 1. Control Plane Node(s)
These nodes are the brains of the cluster. They host the components responsible for managing the overall state and behavior of the cluster. The control plane handles tasks such as:

- Scheduling applications
- Managing workloads
- Monitoring and self-healing
- Rolling out updates

The control plane ensures the desired state of the cluster is maintained.

 2. Worker Nodes
Worker nodes are responsible for running the actual applications. They host the containers scheduled by the control plane. These nodes don’t make decisions on their own; instead, they follow instructions from the control plane. Each worker node includes:

- Kubelet – the agent that communicates with the control plane
- Container runtime – such as containerd or CRI-O to manage containers

 How Kubernetes Works

Kubernetes enables a group of machines—physical or virtual—to work together as a unified cluster. It abstracts the infrastructure so you can deploy containerized applications without being tied to specific machines. Containers allow applications to be packaged in a portable, host-independent format.

Traditional deployment models installed applications directly on specific machines. In contrast, Kubernetes manages the distribution, scaling, and lifecycle of containerized apps automatically.

Kubernetes is open source and production-ready. It offers high availability and resiliency through intelligent scheduling and self-healing mechanisms.

 Kubernetes Cluster Components

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two core resources:

- The Control Plane: Orchestrates and manages the entire cluster.
- Nodes: Serve as the compute machines where applications actually run.

The control plane exposes the Kubernetes API, which both users and internal components (like the Kubelet) use to communicate.

To maintain reliability in a production environment, it’s recommended to run at least three nodes. This helps avoid a single point of failure, especially when running etcd (the cluster’s configuration store) and the control plane on the same node.

 Getting Started with Kubernetes

Kubernetes can be deployed on both virtual and physical infrastructure. To begin local development, you can use tools like:

- Minikube – A lightweight Kubernetes implementation that runs on a single VM
- kind (Kubernetes IN Docker) – For running clusters using Docker containers
- MicroK8s – A low-ops, minimal Kubernetes distribution

These tools are ideal for development and testing environments.

 Setting Up Kubernetes in Production

For setting up production-grade Kubernetes clusters, you have several options:

 Installer Tools
- kubeadm
- kops
- kubespray

 Kubernetes Distributions
These come with bundled tools and sometimes commercial support:
- Rancher
- k3s (lightweight version by Rancher)
- OpenShift (Red Hat)
- VMware Tanzu

Distributions often provide opinionated setups and integrations to simplify operations.

 Managed Kubernetes Services
If you prefer not to manage your own cluster, many cloud providers offer fully managed Kubernetes platforms:
- Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- Google GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
- Microsoft AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)
- DigitalOcean DOKS

These services handle upgrades, scaling, and infrastructure maintenance for you.

In its most basic form, scheduling is a sub-category of container orchestration and describes the process of automatically choosing the right (worker) node to run a containerized workload on. In the past, scheduling was more of a manual task where a system administrator would choose the right server for an application by keeping track of the available servers, their capacity and other properties like where they are located.

In a Kubernetes cluster, the kube-scheduler is the component that makes the scheduling decision, but is not responsible for actually starting the workload. The scheduling process in Kubernetes always starts when a new Pod object is created. Remember that Kubernetes is using a declarative approach, where the Pod is only described first, then the scheduler selects a node where the Pod actually will get started by the kubelet and the container runtime.

Kubernetes Architecture
Terminology
We have learned that Kubernetes is an orchestration system to deploy and manage containers. Containers are not managed individually; instead, they are part of a larger object called a Pod. A Pod consists of one or more containers which share an IP address, access to storage and namespace. Typically, one container in a Pod runs an application, while other containers support the primary application.

Orchestration is managed through a series of watch-loops, also known as operators or controllers. Each operator interrogates the kube-apiserver for a particular object state, modifying the object until the declared state matches the current state. The default, newest, and feature-filled operator for containers is a Deployment. A Deployment deploys and manages a different operator called a ReplicaSet. A replicaSet is an operator which deploys multiple pods, each with the same spec information. These are called replicas. The Kubernetes architecture is made up of many operators such as Jobs and CronJobs to handle single or recurring tasks, or custom resource definitions and purpose-built operators.

There are several other API objects which can be used to deploy pods, other than ensuring a certain number of replicas is running somewhere. A DaemonSet will ensure that a single pod is deployed on every node. These are often used for logging, metrics, and security pods. A StatefulSet can be used to deploy pods in a particular order, such that following pods are only deployed if previous pods report a ready status. This is useful for legacy applications which are not cloud-friendly.

To easily manage thousands of Pods across hundreds of nodes can be difficult. To make management easier, we can use labels, arbitrary strings which become part of the object metadata. These are selectors which can then be used when checking or changing the state of objects without having to know individual names or UIDs. Nodes can have taints, an arbitrary string in the node metadata, to inform the scheduler on Pod assignments used along with toleration in Pod metadata, indicating it should be scheduled on a node with the particular taint.

There is also space in metadata for annotations, which remain with the object, but cannot be used as a selector; however, they could be leveraged by other objects or Pods.

While using lots of smaller, commodity hardware could allow every user to have their very own cluster, often multiple users and teams share access to one or more clusters. This is referred to as multi-tenancy. Some form of isolation is necessary in a multi-tenant cluster, using a combination of the following, which we introduce here but will learn more about in the future:

namespace
A segregation of resources, upon which resource quotas and permissions can be applied. Kubernetes objects may be created in a namespace or cluster-scoped. Users can be limited by the object verbs allowed per namespace. Also the LimitRange admission controller constrains resource usage in that namespace. Two objects cannot have the same Name: value in the same namespace.
context
A combination of user, cluster name and namespace. A convenient way to switch between combinations of permissions and restrictions. For example you may have a development cluster and a production cluster, or may be part of both the operations and architecture namespaces. This information is referenced from ~/.kube/config.
Resource Limits
A way to limit the amount of resources consumed by a pod, or to request a minimum amount of resources reserved, but not necessarily consumed, by a pod. Limits can also be set per-namespaces, which have priority over those in the PodSpec.
Pod Security Admission
A beta feature to restrict pod behavior in an easy-to-implement and easy-to-understand manner, applied at the namespace level when a pod is created. These will leverage three profiles: Privileged, Baseline, and Restricted policies.
Network Policies
The ability to have an inside-the-cluster firewall. Ingress and Egress traffic can be limited according to namespaces and labels as well as typical network traffic characteristics.

Worker Nodes
All worker nodes run the kubelet and kube-proxy, as well as the container engine, such as containerd or cri-o. Other management daemons are deployed to watch these agents or provide services not yet included with Kubernetes.

The kubelet interacts with the underlying container runtime also installed on all the nodes, and makes sure that the containers that need to run are actually running. The kubelet is the heavy lifter for changes and configuration on worker nodes ( a PodSpec is a JSON or YAML file that describes a pod). It will work to configure the local node until the specification has been met.

Should a Pod require access to storage, Secrets or ConfigMaps, the kubelet will ensure access or creation. It also sends back status to the kube-apiserver for eventual persistence.

The kube-proxy is in charge of managing the network connectivity to the containers. It does so through the use of iptables entries. It also has the userspace mode, in which it monitors Services and Endpoints using a random high-number port to proxy traffic. Use of ipvs can be enabled, with the expectation it will become the default, replacing iptables.

Kubernetes does not have cluster-wide logging yet. Instead, another CNCF project is used, called Fluentd. When implemented, it provides a unified logging layer for the cluster, which filters, buffers, and routes messages.

Cluster-wide metrics is not quite fully mature, so Prometheus is also often deployed to gather metrics from nodes and perhaps some applications.

Control Plane Node
The Kubernetes master runs various server and manager processes for the cluster. Among the components of the master node are the kube-apiserver, the kube-scheduler, and the etcd database. As the software has matured, new components have been created to handle dedicated needs, such as the cloud-controller-manager; it handles tasks once handled by the kube-controller-manager to interact with other tools, such as Rancher or DigitalOcean for third-party cluster management and reporting.

There are several add-ons which have become essential to a typical production cluster, such as DNS services. Others are third-party solutions where Kubernetes has not yet developed a local component, such as cluster-level logging and resource monitoring.

Services
With every object and agent decoupled we need a flexible and scalable operator which connects resources together and will reconnect, should something die and a replacement is spawned. Each Service is a microservice handling a particular bit of traffic, such as a single NodePort or a LoadBalancer to distribute inbound requests among many Pods.

A Service also handles access policies for inbound requests, useful for resource control, as well as for security.


Operators
An important concept for orchestration is the use of operators. These are also known as watch-loops and controllers. They query the current state, compare it against the spec, and execute code based on how they differ. Various operators ship with Kubernetes, and you can create your own, as well. A simplified view of an operator is an agent, or Informer, and a downstream store.


A Pod is a group of co-located containers that share the same IP address. From a networking perspective, a Pod can be seen as a virtual machine of physical hosts. The network needs to assign IP addresses to Pods, and needs to provide traffic routes between all Pods on any nodes.

The three main networking challenges to solve in a container orchestration system are:

Coupled container-to-container communications (solved by the Pod concept)
Pod-to-Pod communications
External-to-Pod communications.
Kubernetes expects the network configuration to enable Pod-to-Pod communications to be available; it will not do it for you.

Pods are assigned an IP address prior to application containers being started. The service object is used to connect Pods within the network using ClusterIP addresses, from outside of the cluster using NodePort addresses, and using a load balancer if configured with a LoadBalancer service.
